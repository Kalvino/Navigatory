This company wants to make a website that helps people plan a trip to the Western Kenay from Europe. So it will have 

a home page (slide 1), 
a broweseable area of the site that allows people to learn more about the region (slide 2),



When you select an itinerary from the top list (see the thumbnails) they'll be able to see the details below. These will include "places" which indicate a place where they're going to spend a night in a hotel and probably (but not always) a couple activities. 

Therefore the thing they see below the thumbails on slide 8 is a list of all of their chosen places. They may have started with an example itinerary in which case this will be pre-populated, or they may have a blank itinerary. There is an option at the bottom of the list (or the only thing they see if they start with a blank) that says "add a new place."
